# Backend Senior Coding Challenge üçø

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- [*] The backend should expose RESTful endpoints to handle user input and
  return movie ratings.
- [*] The system should store data in a database. You can use any existing
  dataset or API to populate the initial database.
- [*] Implement user endpoints to create and view user information.
- [*] Implement movie endpoints to create and view movie information.
- [*] Implement a rating system to rate the entertainment value of a movie.
- [*] Implement a basic profile where users can view their rated movies.
- [*] Include unit tests to ensure the reliability of your code.
- [*] Ensure proper error handling and validation of user inputs.

## ‚ú® Bonus Points

- [*] Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for users.
- [*] Provide documentation for your API endpoints using tools like Swagger.
- [*] Implement logging to record errors and debug information.
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms to improve the rating system's performance.
- [ ] Implement CI/CD quality gates.


# Movie Rating API

## Project Overview

This is a Ruby on Rails API built for managing and rating movies. It provides endpoints for user authentication, movie creation/retrieval, and user ratings. The API follows JSON:API conventions and leverages JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

### System Design

#### The API follows a layered architecture:

- Controller Layer: Handles incoming HTTP requests, interacts with service objects, and renders JSON API responses.
- Service Layer: Encapsulates business logic related to rating functionality.
- Model Layer: Represents the data entities (User, Movie, Rating) and their relationships.
- Data Access Layer (Active Record): Handles database interactions and provides an abstraction over the underlying database.

**Key Features:**

*   User registration and login (JWT authentication)
*   Create, retrieve, movies
*   Rate movies (1-10 scale) with average rating calculation
*   API versioning
*   Error handling and input validation
*   RSpec test suite with FactoryBot for test data generation

**Future Improvements:**

*   User roles (normal user, admin) with authorization to restrict movie creation to admins.
*   Background job processing for average rating calculation (using Sidekiq or similar).
*   Potential implementation of a Redis cache to store and update average ratings efficiently.

## Technologies Used
*   Ruby 3.3.0
*   Rails 7.1.3
*   SQLite (development database)
*   JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
*   jsonapi-serializer for JSON:API serialization
*   RSpec for testing


## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
  * Make sure you have Ruby 3.3.0 installed

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
    *   Update `.env` with your actual credentials (e.g., JWT secret key).

4.  **Prepare the Database:**
    ```bash
    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate
    ```

5.  **Seed the Database:**
    ```bash
    rails db:seed
    ```

6.  **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    rails s
    ```

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
rspec
  ```
